    "# EGM722 - Week 5 Practical: Vector and raster operations using python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, we have worked with either vector data or raster data, but we haven't really used them together. In this week's practical, we'll learn how we can combine these two data types, and see some examples of different analyses, such as zonal statistics or sampling raster data, that we can automate using python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "-  learn how to use `rasterstats` to perform zonal statistics\n",
    "-  learn how to handle exceptions using try...except\n",
    "-  rasterize polygon data using `rasterio`\n",
    "-  learn how to mask and select (index) rasters using vector data\n",
    "-  see additional plotting examples using matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data provided\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data\\_files folder, you should have the following:\n",
    "-  LCM2015_Aggregate_100m.tif\n",
    "-  NI_DEM.tif\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, we'll look at a number of different GIS tasks related to working with both raster and vector data in python, as well as a few different python and programming concepts. To get started, run the cell below."

    "In GIS, [_zonal statistics_](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/how-zonal-statistics-works.htm) is a process whereby you calculate statistics for the pixels of a raster in different groups, or zones, defined by properties in another dataset. In this example, we're going to use the Northern Ireland County border dataset from Week 2, along with a re-classified version of the Northern Ireland [Land Cover Map](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/47f053a0-e34f-4534-a843-76f0a0998a2f) 2015[<sup id=\"fn1-back\">1</sup>](#fn1 \"footnote 1\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The Land Cover Map tells, for each pixel, what type of land cover is associated with a location - that is, whether it's woodland (and what kind of woodland), grassland, urban or built-up areas, and so on. For our re-classified version of the dataset, we're working with the aggregate class data, re-sampled to 100m resolution from the original 25m resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raster data type is _unsigned integer_ with a _bitdepth_ of 8 bits - that is, it has a range of possible values from 0 to 255. Even though it has this range of possible values, we only use 10 (11) of them:\n",
